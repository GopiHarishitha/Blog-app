#Blog-App
The blog app, developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), is designed to provide a community of literature enthusiasts. 
This dual-interface application allows users to register as either readers or authors. 
Readers can enjoy a clean, user-friendly interface where they can easily browse, search for specific articles, and read the articles. 
On the other hand, authors are provided with a comprehensive dashboard to create, edit, and publish their content. 
This includes tools for writing and formatting posts, and managing their publications.

The platform encourages community engagement through features like comments, allowing readers to interact with authors directly. 
Built with security and scalability in mind, the app efficiently handles a growing user base and increasing content volume.
